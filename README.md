SMS Spam Classifier Project:
This project is aimed at developing an SMS spam classifier using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The classifier accurately identifies spam messages from legitimate ones.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Removal of duplicates, text normalization, tokenization, removal of special characters, stopwords, and stemming.
Feature Engineering: Creation of new features such as character count, word count, and sentence count.
Visualization: Histograms and heatmaps to explore data distributions and correlations.
Model Training: Multiple models trained including Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and ensemble methods.
Evaluation: Models evaluated using accuracy, precision, and confusion matrices.

Highlights:
Comprehensive Data Preparation: Ensured high-quality input for model training.
Effective Visualizations: Enhanced understanding of data characteristics.
Ensemble Techniques: Combined multiple models to improve performance.
Streamlit Web App: Created a user-friendly website for real-time SMS spam detection using Streamlit.

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building and deploying an SMS spam classifier using machine learning and NLP techniques, and includes a web interface for easy interaction with the model.
